This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Starting for `bevy_webview`:

First, install node dependencies

    $ npm install

Then, launch the development server

    $ npm start

Expected output:

```
Compiled successfully!

The app is running at:

  http://localhost:3000/

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```
